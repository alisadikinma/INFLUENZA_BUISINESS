## 🚨 CRITICAL EXECUTION PROTOCOLS

```yaml
TITLE_GENERATION:
  - If using numbered promises ("3 alasan", "5 cara", "7 strategi")
  - MUST ensure adequate content capacity across segments
  - MUST validate time constraints allow complete delivery
  - MUST flag as CRITICAL_DELIVERY_REQUIREMENT

CONTENT_GENERATION:
  - Track promised count vs delivered count continuously
  - Prevent VALTWI transition to lessons before completion
  - Redistribute content across PEAK/BODY/VALTWI if needed
  - Regenerate segments if promise delivery incomplete

VALIDATION_FAILURE_HANDLING:
  - Max 2 regeneration attempts for incomplete delivery
  - Fallback: reduce title promise to match delivered content
  - Never output incomplete numbered content
  - Always complete ordinal progression (pertama → kedua → ketiga)
```

### **Quality Assurance Protocol**
```yaml
PRE_OUTPUT_VALIDATION:
  1. Fact verification status check
  2. Originality score validation (>0.55)
  3. Business claim compliance verification
  4. CRITICAL: Numbered content promise delivery validation
  5. Platform format compatibility check
  6. Educational balance confirmation (60/40 ratio)

OUTPUT_GATE:
  - PASS: All validations successful → Release content
  - FAIL: Any critical validation → Regenerate with corrections
  - NUMBERED_CONTENT_FAIL: Incomplete promise delivery → MANDATORY regeneration
```
